# Midnight Cypher

Given the current state of revolt around the world, as the people from all countries have found themselves fed up with injustice, and have finally come out to protest, there is the need to provide them support, and let them speak safely.

The project hereby, called Mignight Cypher allows for freedom of speech where it has been prohibited, as by the usage of steganography it hides messages from plain sight in the least-significant bits of a random image obtained from my secure and private search engine called [FUTURE](https://wearebuildingthefuture.com/) which also leaves no trace of any information processed.

Remember, this could potentially save lives, and you can help by cloning the repo and starting your own mirror, as I have reduced bandwidth and processing power.

Let's rise.
